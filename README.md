# NDN-IFA
Meant to contain code to mount IFAs in NDN networks and measure their impact on ndnSIM. The code of this repository contains applications reading content identifiers from text files. This was meant to have realistic names in simulations as part of steadier attack model presented in [1]. Lists of names used for the experiments in [1] have been described therein. The README file in the directory ndnSim1.0-code/apps includes some additional information about the lists of names.

If you use some of this code for your research work, you may also consider citing the following work which has led to the development of most of the software in this repository:
