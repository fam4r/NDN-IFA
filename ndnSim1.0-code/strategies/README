Distributed Poseidon Forwarding Strategy
-----------------------------------------------
Statistics and parameters (as much as possible equivalent to the definitions reported in the original paper):


Rij identifies the j-th interface on router Ri

- tk: k-th time interval 

- omega(Rij,tk): num of Interests from Rij at interval tk/num of contents to Rij at interval tk

- pit_usage(Rij, tk): PIT space (num of bytes in the original paper, while num of entries in this implementation) used by Interests arrived on interface Rij and measured at the end of tk

- omega_thd: detection threshold for omega(Rij,tk) [class Attribute &Poseidon::m_omega]

- pit_usage_thd: detection threshold for pit_usage(Rij, tk) [class Attribute &Poseidon::m_rho]

- scale_factor: factor used to lower omega and rho thresholds upon the reception of an alarm [class Attribute &Poseidon::m_scale]

- time_interval: time interval over which statistics are collected, every time_interval faces statistics are cleaned [class Attribute &Poseidon::m_timeInterval]

- wait_time: minimum inter-gap between two alerts at the same interface [class Attribute &Poseidon::m_waitTime]

- namespace for pushing notifications downstream [class Attribute &Poseidon::CreateAlertsName]


Summary of the main behaviors implemented by this forwarding strategy:

			ConditionA: if( omega(Rij,tk) > omega_thd AND pit_usage (Rij, tk) > pit_usage_thd)

			ConditionB: if(time_last(rij) > wait_time)

- at Interest Reception:
	Load Statistics (omega and pit_usage) for the face
	if ConditionA, then:
	  if ConditionB, then:
		Generate Pushback Alarm
	  else
		drop Interest // side-note: I am not sure this behavior is fully correct/intended
	else
		forward according to the parent forwarding strategy method, yet override DidSendOutInterest to record statistics

- at Data Reception:
	if the Data is push-back alarm, then
		if no other alert has been received for this face within a m_waitTime interval, then
		thresholds for both omega and pit are scaled down according to the received scaling factor*	
	else
		Data is forwarded normally


- Generate Pushback Alarm: called by the onInterest method when both conditionA and conditionB are met, it pushes out a Data packet, whose name is the string stored in the CreateAlertsName class variable.

* Indeed, a static scale factor, stored in &Poseidon::m_scale, is used by the nodes. The scale factor could be easily carried as payload in the related Push-Back notification (TBD).
